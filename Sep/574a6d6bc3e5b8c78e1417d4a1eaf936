 In the matter of KHUMALO ZAKHELE                                                                                         APPLICANT AND ILANGA NEWSPAPER                                                                                 RESPONDENT MATTER NO: 7805/02/2020 DECISION ON APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL He said the sub-headline read “Kuxoshwa asebephendule amagumbi okufunda imizi yabo” which he himself translated into English as “those who have turned classrooms into their homes are being chased away”. He says the heading and the sub-headline are in violation of article 10.1 of the Code as they are not a reasonable reflection of the content of the story. The applicant argues that nowhere in the story is it state that they were chased away; that happened only after the publication. He also argues that the sub-headline incorrectly stated that they had turned the classrooms into their homes. He also complained about the heading on page 5: “Bakhala ngocansi ‘oluphazamisa abantundi’” which he translated as “They are complaining about sexual intercourse ‘disturbing learners’”. The allegations is also denied. As the headlines indicate, the issue was the occupation of a building which some people believed belonged to the government, being part of a school. Some families occupied the building and lived there. All other complaints revolved on that issue. Notably, there are contentions that the building had been donated to a certain woman prior to 1994 who in turn rented it out to the families living there. The school governing body, the principal and students wanted those families to leave as the building was part of the school; they wanted more classrooms. The Ombud, in his Ruling dated 18 August 2020, summed up the complaints accurately. The application is dismissed. Dated this 7th day of September 2020 Judge B M Ngoepe, Chair, Appeals Panel
