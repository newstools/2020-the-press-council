 BEFORE THE APPEL PANEL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESS COUNCIL In the matter between NOVA PROPERTY HOLDINGS LIMITED                                                      APPLICANT AND MONEYWEB                                                                                                   RESPONDENT MATTER NO: 7795/02/2020 DECISION ON AN APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL “1.1   Mr Connie Myburgh complains that the editor: 1.2    He asks for a rectification, retraction and apology to Nova and him, both as an individual and as Nova’s chairperson.” I also agree with the Ombud’s summary that the article was about a meeting of the creditors of Ortotouch held in November 2019; and that the article was about the apparent failure of the Orthotouch directors in carrying out their fiduciary duties to implement the rescue plans. “Nova requires the Ombud to take steps against Moneyweb, in order to procure that Moneyweb does not utilise, make available or allow Moneyweb’s Platform to accommodate and be used by members of the public to comment on Moneyweb’s Platform with irrelevant matters, hate speech, aggression, insults, outpouring of venom and personal attacks, with reference to articles published by Moneyweb , and in particular insofar as such articles and comments relate to Nova  and its functionaries”. It is a startling but revealing request: The Ombud must take steps to silence the public – which would include aggrieved investors – from saying whatever they want to say; I suppose they should only be allowed to sing praises to Nova! Contrast that with the following submission by Mr Van Niekerk: “The investing public have the right to be informed about these matters, not only so people who are in position for corporate power can be held to account, but also to educate themselves about, and protect themselves against the kind of investments. This is a duty I owe to (my) readers ….” This is what investigative journalism is about; and therein lies its value to the public. The Press Code cannot be used to stifle information which should go out to the public. Dated this 15th day of October 2020 Judge B M Ngoepe, Chair, Appeals Panel
