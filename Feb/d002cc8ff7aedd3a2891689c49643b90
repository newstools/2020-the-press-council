He is one of our most-experienced adjudicators who has contributed to many rulings, hearings and appeals at the Press Council during the past decade. “He understands the Press Code of South Africa intimately, having contributed deeply to its development, and  he will act as the complainants’ friend – helping complainants to formulate their complaints against our subscriber members who may have transgressed and attempting to mediate fair and reasonable settlements. “If he is unable to resolve matters by mediation and they get referred to Ms Pippa Green, the Press Ombud, for adjudication; Fanie will be available to assist and act as the representative of the complainant at the hearing. “It is a vital role in the Press Council  and Fanie will act to ensure that the process, which is free to complainants, is speedy and efficient.”  Ends
